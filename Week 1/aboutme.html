            About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
            I am currently a fourth year student at UCLA studying <b>Human Biology & Society (HBS) and Sociology.</b>
            As an out of state student, I have spent <i>all</i> of this academic year at home in New Jersey, and am excited to meet more people through this class and learn about web mapping.
            Last quarter, I worked with Dr. Venkat in the <i>Heat Lab</i> to explore heat inequalities in LA. My group made an ArcGIS StoryMap that incorporated a variety of different types of reesearch, including GIS mapping.
            That experience really piqued my interest in mapping and GIS and I hope that I will be able to develop some technical skills through this course.

            For this class in particular, I'm excited to explore three main areas of interest:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>built environments and urban planning
                <ul>
                    <li>access to urban green spaces</li>
                    <li>effects of green architectural standards in housing on health</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>climate change</li>
            <li>public health</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Since I have been spending so much time at home, I have gotten really into cooking and have also taken the opportunity to explore my neighborhood on my runs.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is a meal I made for my family
                    <br>

                </li>
                <li>
                    and this is a picture I took while on a run back in January
                    <br>
