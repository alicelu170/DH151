		<h3>Places I've Lived</h3>
        <p> I am fortunate to have been able to call a variety of places around the world home, even if for a brief period.
            <br>
            Here are 6 of the places I spent at least two months in!
        <ol>
            <li>I grew up in <b>Plainsboro, NJ.</b> As the name suggests, the town was plain and the land was open and expansive. I have many fond memories of running around the backyard with my sibilings and riding bikes with my neighborhood friends.
            </li>
            <li> Zooming out, I moved to <b>Hong Kong</b> after fourth grade, and spent the next five years in this exciting city.
            </li>
            <li>Next, I finished up my last three years of high school in <b>Massachusetts</b>.
            </li>
            <li>After high school, I was excited to attend UCLA and explore the coast I had never been to! I spent my first year at UCLA in <b>Dykstra Hall</b>.
            </li>
            <li>After my second year at UCLA, I went abroad for the summer to study physics at the <b>University of Nicosia</b> in the island country of Cyprus.
            </li>
            <li>Although it has been bittersweet to be finishing my last year of college from home, it has been nice to spend some more time with family back in <b>Princeton, NJ</b>. 
            </li>
        </ol>
