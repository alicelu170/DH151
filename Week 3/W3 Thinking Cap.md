# Reflections on UXD

I think it is fascinating to see the amount of work that goes into designing and creating products that intentially appear simple and are often taken for granted. I was also surprised by how many levels UX designers work on, from evaluating need all the way to designing the final product. It makes sense that UXD essentially provides a voice for the user, since they often do not have the chance to work closely with a company. However, I understand that this overview of UXD is very preliminary and I am interested in hearing more about the nuances of this process.

# Questions

Many facets of the UXD process reminded me of community-centered design, such as in areas of architecture and urban planning. In these instances, community-centered design attempts to create a paradigm shift by bringing community members and stakeholders (the users) directly into design processes. While I understand that UXD tries to plan for the user's experience, do you think a community- and user- centered approach to product design that relies less on UXD as a mediator between users and companies is possible?

With UXD perhaps becoming more common and well-known, have you seen a shift in the background that your coworkers come from? That is, what areas of study or experiences do those involved in UXD have?

Inclusivity is important for ensuring the user experience is positive across large populations. In your experience, are your teams diverse in background, race, SES, ability, gender, sexuality, etc.? How have you felt this diversity (or lack thereof) affect the product design process?
