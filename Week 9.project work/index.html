    <h2 class = "font1">THE GLOBAL IMPACT OF WASTE</h2>
    <p class="font2">
      The goal of Rethink Recycle is to help users understand the scope of the global waste-management network. While many of us are able to sort our plastic waste and hope that it is in fact recycled and repurposed, the truth is that the recycling process is not so straightforward. 
      <br>
      The United States only recycles a fraction of its plastic waste and instead exports a large amount of it to countries across the globe. While countries differ in the way they manage their own waste, these practices also all have different effects on both human and environmental health. Mismanaged plastic waste has been shown to increase risk of cardiovascular disease and affect access to potable water. Therefore, the true impact of plastic waste goes beyond sorting oneâ€™s recycling; Rethink Recycle hopes to make this reality clearer.

    <p class = "font2">
      The Rethink Recycle map shows the global trade of plastic waste that the United States engaged in between the years of 2016 to 2018. 
      <br>
      Click on a year in the sidebar to show the United States' network of plastic waste trade in the world for that given year. 
      <br>
      Hover over a circle to view the popup that will include the country name and the amount of plastic waste being transported. All circle sizes are proportional to the amount of plastic transported.

		<p class = "font2">This map shows the amount of plastic waste that are mismanaged in each country. Hover over a country to see the amount of mismanaged plastic waste.
      <br>
      Plastics contain toxic chemicals, which are phthalates, poly-fluorinated chemicals, bisphenol A (BPA), brominated flame retardants, and antimony trioxide. 
			Therefore, mismanaged plastic waste can pollute the environment. 
			The pollutions in water and air increase the risk of health issues, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurobehavioral disorders, and reproductive health issues.
			This is why it is important to raise awareness towards mismanaged plastic waste in the world. (<a href="https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijtra/international-journal-of-toxicology-and-risk-assessment-ijtra-5-021.php?jid=ijtra">Alabi et.al., 2019</a>) </p>
