## What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?" ##
I really like the emphasis placed on the temporal aspects of thick mapping as a practice that transcends time for geographic or place-specific data. I agree that thick mapping introduces questions of "memory, narrative, archival practices, knowledge, design, and, finally, ethics" into practices of mapping, thus making the marriage of digital humanities plausible (p.20). While I do think that think mapping brings in a level of open-endedness and subjectivity that is akin to the humanities, and therefore differentiates itself from mapping, I also think that think mapping allows for alternative epistemological ways of knowing histories and narratives. Considering the role that mapping has played historically in settler-colonialism, thick mapping is almost radical in its practice of bringing different narratives and histories to the forefront. 

## How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life? ##
As someone interested in environment health and justice, the idea of environmental remediation has always left me with more questions than answers. Practices to clean up brownfields and superfund sites may target a specific contaminant that is known to exist, but how can it account for the accumulation of possible environmental hazards throughout an area's history? In this context, I think that thick mapping can offer a way of tethering the exploration of historical narratives on lands and environents to specific geographical place.
